# pogo-rankings-builder

Settings are in the comments of build-rankings.py and can be adjusted as you see fit.

setup:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

There's settings that can be configured to change the outputs within the primary file.
	https://github.com/Seariyu/pogo-rankings-builder/blob/master/build-rankings.py
	The current settings limit the size and volume of pokemon the builder outputs so that the file generated contains the more relevant pokemon for PVP without being giant.

running the generator:

	python build-rankings.py
